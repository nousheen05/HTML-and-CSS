Q) What is internet?
- Internet is nothing but a global network of computers 
- The huge amount of data like websites, videos etc are stored inside some server(a computer working 24hrs) and this data is transmitted through optical fibres 


Q) But we dont have any direct connection to that stored computer device through any cable?then how we get data?
- Before that we should know something called as IP address
- Q) what is IP address?It is unique string of numbers that identifies a device(computer/alexa/router/mobile) connected to internet
- for ex: the server storing youtube website will have some IP address. 
- We can access youtube by that IP address, but as it is difficult to remember so many ip addresses we use domain names that corresponds to IP addresses

=>computers talk to each other and thats how we access data.
